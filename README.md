# CodeReviewTest

This test is based on the exercise from this repository: https://github.com/Tarcaye/code-review-interview

## Steps for creating the test

All steps can be done directly from GitHub, but you can also do it cloning the repository in your local.

1. Select branch ``feature/basket-informations``.
2. Edit the file ``candidateName.txt`` with your name and create a **new branch**.
3. Create a PR from this new branch to ``master`` and put your name in the title.
4. Start a review with the comments you think need to be added.

### Info
* There may be other candidates branches with PRs and comments. We cannot force that you don't check them, but we're more 
interested to see what you write and how you communicate in a CR environment. Part of the CR is done during the next 
interview with the team.
* You don't need to point out every mistake if you don't want. We will not check quantity, but which and why.
